### Text Formatting

**Bold text** makes important information stand out, while *italic text* adds emphasis. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ to indicate deleted content.

> **Pro Tip**: Use formatting consistently throughout your document to maintain a professional appearance.

### Paragraph Formatting

Word offers several paragraph alignment options:

- **Left Align** (default): Text aligns to the left margin
- **Center Align**: Text centers between margins

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

**Numbered Lists:**

2. Second step
3. Third step

## Best Practices

### Document Organization

1. **Use Headings**: Create a clear hierarchy with heading styles
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Apply the same fonts and spacing throughout
3. **White Space**: Use margins and spacing to improve readability
4. **Proofreading**: Always review your document before finalizing

### File Management

```text
File naming conventions:
• Use descriptive names
• Include dates when relevant
• Avoid special characters
• Use underscores instead of spaces
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Text Not Appearing

If text isn't appearing where you expect:

1. Check if you're in the correct view mode
2. Ensure the cursor is positioned correctly
3. Verify that text color isn't set to white
4. Check if the document is in read-only mode

### Formatting Problems

When formatting doesn't apply correctly:

- Select the text first, then apply formatting
- Use the Format Painter tool to copy formatting
- Clear formatting with Ctrl + Space if needed
- Check if styles are overriding your formatting

## Exercise: Create Your First Document

3. **Format the title** as Heading 1
4. **Add your name** and the current date
5. **Create a simple list** of agenda items
6. **Save the document** with a descriptive name
